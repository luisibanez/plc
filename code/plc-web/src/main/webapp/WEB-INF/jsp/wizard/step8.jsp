    <h3 id="description_of_volunteer_population">Description of Volunteer Population:</h3>

    <p>We are seeking a diverse range of volunteers from a wide range of genetic, social and environmental
        backgrounds to participate in common genomics research. Volunteers must be willing to make their genetic and
        other health and human trait information publicly available as part of this study. In order to provide informed
        consent to participate, volunteers must be knowledgeable about the science of genetics, the process of human
        subjects research and the risks of participation in a common genomics research study of this nature. Our goal is
        to create a network of databases of common genomics information that can be used for studies not yet imagined,
        so that we might begin as a society to connect the minute differences in our genomes to diseases, drug response,
        and more.</p>

    <h3 id="what_is_informed_consent">What is Informed Consent?</h3>

    <p>
        Informed consent means you understand the procedures, risks, possible benefits, and alternatives before you
        voluntarily agree to participate in a research study. Before you elect to participate, you need to understand if
        or how this study may affect you and your family. This form, along with the educational software and content
        around it and available at <a href="http://weconsent.us" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://weconsent.us"
            rel="nofollow">http://weconsent.us</a>, is intended to help you make an informed decision about your
        participation in this study. The website will be updated as needed, possibly on a frequent basis, and
        participants and prospective participants should check the website regularly to obtain the most current
        information about this study.
    </p>

    <h3 id="who_is_eligible_to_participate_in_this_study">Who is Eligible to Participate in this Study?</h3>

    <p>The Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomics Research (PLC-CGR) study is open to anyone who demonstrates an
        understanding of the concept of informed consent and of the risks involved in common genomic research, and who
        then provide their informed consent to enroll in the PLC-CGR.</p>

    <p>More broadly, the PLC-CGR utilizes the Common Genomics Research ("CGR") framework to identify potential
        participants for genomic research and biobanking projects which seek to share data in order to benefit the
        common good. Your completion of the CGR training module, as well as your satisfaction of the minimum
        requirements described above, demonstrate your capacity to provide informed consent to participate in Portable
        Legal Consent for Common Genomics Research. This document is intended to help you further understand the
        benefits and risks of participating in CGR projects generally, and in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomics
        Research specifically, in order to help you make a fully informed about whether to participate in the PLC-CGR.</p>

    <p>Signing up for the PLC-CGR study is not a decision to take lightly. Publishing health information and genomes
        is a new activity. That means the risks to you as an individual are difficult to estimate. The study aims to
        create social benefits by helping us understand how genomes actually drive health - which is done by creating a
        large group of people who are willing to share their data in the face of uncertainty, because they believe in
        the social good that can be created. Please make sure you take the time to not only read about the risks, but
        think about them, before you decide to enter the study. Also, be sure to contemplate the long term aspects of
        the study. This is not a study where your data is locked in a file cabinet as pieces of paper, and your data
        will move around as it becomes part of the scientific research into genomes and health. You will be allowed to
        withdraw your data at any time, but the nature of the study means that copies of your data may have been made
        and distributed in ways that make it impossible to retrieve them.</p>

    <h3 id="short_description_of_the_cgr_framework">About the PLC-CGR Framework - Short Description</h3>

    <p>Traditionally, most scientific research has been a one-way process involving a small number of people. A
        limited group of individuals volunteer time and data in the name of improving our collective understanding and
        small groups of researchers then work to analyze that data and publish their findings in scientific literature.
        For comparison's sake, one of the most important studies ever performed only enrolled 25,000 people over more
        than 50 years. And these studies are usually one-shot projects. Once the project is over, it's over, and
        re-using the data is hard to do.</p>

    <p>The aim of the Common Genomics Research framework is to create a far larger group participants, and to make
        it far easier to re-use the data again and again. It allows people like you to play an active role in the
        scientific research process. The CGR is built on technical and legal tools that permit participants to broadly
        share and distribute their data in the public domain. These tools make it easy for researchers to use your data
        to improve our common understanding of human genomics and health.</p>

    <p>One of the primary aims of the CGR is to build large, open datasets and tools that make it easy for
        scientists to work together and innovate on top of health data. While the CGR believes that promoting public
        research is crucial to the rapid advancement of scientific and medical knowledge, we also recognize that it
        carries a unique set of risks and considerations for participants. This document is designed to help you
        understand those risks and to make an informed choice about whether to participate in Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomics Research.</p>

    <h3 id="long_description_of_the_cgr_framework">About the CGR Framework - Long Description</h3>

    <p>The fundamental purpose of the "Common Genomic Research" (or "CGR") framework is to allow participants, like
        you, to play an active role in the scientific research process. This section of the document is designed to help
        you understand each component of the CGR: Common, Genomic, and Research, as well as some of the important issues
        that surround CGR and the idea of informed consent.</p>

    <p>By "common," we mean that the data that goes into the PLC-CGR network of databases will be made available in
        an "open" manner - rather than trying to control who access the information, we'll try to increase the number of
        people who can see and use your data for research. This is the opposite of the old model, in which every study
        required its own informed consent process, and the data that emerged were private, not connectable to data from
        other studies, and not available for studies that come afterwards. Now that we have completed the Human Genome
        Project, we know the genes that we have in common. But we do not yet know how the small differences that mark us
        as individuals connect to the realities of our health, our lives, our bodies, and why some of us respond to
        drugs while others do not.</p>

    <p>We can begin to fill this knowledge gap. Creating a large, powerful dataset of genotypes connected to health
        outcomes can advance our understanding of our genes and improve our ability to develop and deliver the promise
        of personalized medicine. If we can assemble a large enough set of these genotype-phenotype combinations, it
        becomes possible to use the same kinds of technologies that allow us to search the Web - but instead of looking
        for content, we can search for groups of genetic changes and explore how they are tied to health. An example
        would be a group of 100 people who take a cancer drug, but only 25 of them get better. If all 100 were in the
        PLC study, we could explore their data and find the subtle similarities among those who did and did not respond.
        This could lead towards an increase in our ability to identify which cancer patients might benefit from the
        treatment.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that "common genomic research" is not precisely the same as "public genomic research"
        - a commons means that some rules do apply, that some rights are reserved, and that there are some methods used
        to enforce those rules. This is because common genomics research carries with it the possibility of
        complications, including the risks which are examined in detail in Article VI of this document. In order to
        mitigate those risks, are going to require all users accept terms in which they agree to act in ways that are
        consistent with socially beneficial use of this data - to agree they will not try to reidentify you, they will
        not harm you by raising your insurance rates, they will make their research results public, and they won't
        transfer the data to anyone who doesn't play by the same rules.</p>

    <p>
        These rules do not provide perfect protection - it is difficult to identify and stop determined rule breakers,
        and there may be risks involved in common genomic research we haven't even thought of. But they do help
        establish an expected standard of conduct for operating within the CGR framework. These rules will be
        implemented either as website Terms of Service, which are published on a website where data is provided to
        users, or as a contract between a website and its users that is tied to user names and user activity. In fully
        public genomic research, fewer such rules are applied, and genomic and other data may be placed on the web
        without any restrictions, identification of users or other significant legal, technical, or normative conditions
        on use. The Personal Genome Project at Harvard Medical School (<a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/"
            rel="nofollow">http://www.personalgenomes.org/</a>) is a good example of public genomic research, and an
        inspiration to this study.
    </p>

    <p>By "genomic" data we mean two kinds of data. First, we mean your individual genomic data - much of which we
        share with every other human, but some small part of which helps to make us unique individuals. This is "stable"
        genomic data, with us since birth, typically comes from sources such as cheek swabs, spit samples, and blood,
        and the samples are consumed as part of the data generation process. Second, we mean data about how you, and
        your genome, react to certain situations, ranging from what you eat to how you respond to a drug to how a
        disease is affecting you. This is "dynamic" genomic data and it often comes from blood samples, tumor samples,
        and other tissue samples, and it might be collected many times over the course of your life.</p>

    <p>The mechanisms for collecting and generating both "static" and "dynamic" genomic data are continuing to
        improve and to evolve and, as a result, we ask PLC-CGR participants to consent to a forward-looking conception
        of data collection. In the years that come you may have the option - but will never be required - to contribute
        data in a variety of ways, using machines yet to be invented, over a multi-month or multi-year period.</p>

    <p>By "research," we mean a wide range of disparate activities. First, we mean traditional scientific research
        performed in laboratories, which can happen at universities, in corporate R&amp;D departments, at not-for-profit
        research foundations, and more. All of these kinds of research are allowed under the CGR framework. We do ask,
        however, that publications emerging from CGR-based research are made available under "open access" terms, which
        helps to ensure that all PLC-CGR participants will have the ability, should they desire, to read, download and
        follow the published research that emerges from their contributions.</p>

    <p>But we also mean new forms of research that are emerging from the internet itself including the ability of
        small groups of patients and doctors to observe themselves in small groups and make connections between their
        own health and their own genomes. We have designed the CGR framework to accommodate this new research model, as
        well as other models, perhaps even more novel, as they arrive in the coming years. Our ultimate goal is to
        enable research broadly, and to ensure that the data you contribute helps advance scientific research and
        understanding to the greatest possible extent.</p>

    <p>To be clear, one of the goals of the CGR is to facilitate the emergence of products built on common data: new
        drugs, new diagnostics, software applications, hardware, and more. The CGR framework permits commercial users
        and applications - if you choose to enroll in the CGRP your data might help a company make a profit - but your
        data itself will always be treated as a common good, available to all who agree to abide by the CGR framework,
        and never as a product itself.</p>

    <h3 id="creating_the_cgr_framework">Creating the CGR Framework.</h3>

    <p>To create the commons we describe above, we need a system that allows citizens to voluntarily enroll in
        common genomic research, and to do so with full knowledge of the risks and benefits common genomic research
        entails. This is where "informed consent" enters the picture. Informed consent is a simple idea that says the
        group who is running a study should disclose the risks of that study to the people that join the study, as well
        as the risks that are important to an individual participant. Informed consent is designed to protect the people
        who enroll in studies from being harmed by unethical or poorly designed science.</p>

    <p>However, one of the unintended side effects of informed consent, historically, has been to make it hard to
        recombine data from studies with one another, and another is to "lock up" the consent for a person inside a
        single study. So if you enroll in five studies, you'll consent five times, and no scientist can come along later
        and put it all together in a way that is additive to learn more about why your genome affects your health the
        way that it does.</p>

    <p>The consent process in the CGR uses a more modern approach, one which we are calling Portable Legal Consent.
        Portable Legal Consent embeds the idea that we should disclose risks about research inside the idea that data
        should be something that can be shared and remixed, to allow unexpected discoveries to emerge from the
        combination of earlier studies by later scientists. If you complete the CGR process, you will have an informed
        consent that travels with you from study to study, that travels with your data from study to study - that is
        portable to you, and that is owned by you. You would need to ask for a copy of the data that is generated about
        you, and then you would always be able to upload it into the PLC-CGR. It's your choice.</p>

    <p>Think of it like a driver's license for genomic research: it won't necessarily let you drive everywhere in
        the world (some research studies will continue to require their own unique informed consent, just like some
        gated communities build their own private roads for their residents), and it may occasionally need to be
        renewed, but in time it will make it vastly easier for you to participate in a wide range of genomic research
        opportunities. Our hope is that the PLC-CGR is only the beginning.</p>

    <h3 id="about_portable_legal_consent">About Portable Legal Consent - Common Genomics Research</h3>

    <p>Sage Bionetworks is conducting a study that will collect genomic, phenotypic, observational, and other forms
        of information from individuals who have opted into a Common Genomic Research framework. The information will be
        collected by electronic means, including websites and software applications, and by a variety of different
        organizations, including disease research foundations, research institutions, hospitals, and companies engaged
        in health and life sciences research.</p>

    <p>The information will be provided by the individuals to the study, and not created by the study investigators.
        If individuals wish, it will be possible to authorize legal representatives to upload data on their behalf, and
        it is possible that investigators in other studies will choose to make the PLC-CGR study part of those studies.
        But the PLC-CGR study does not intend to take physical specimens or create data directly. Our goal is to allow
        people to upload data about themselves into a space where researchers can access it to derive new knowledge.</p>

    <p>Data collected under PLC-CGR will be made available to a broad variety of users for research purposes, with
        few controls on use other than the traditional medical principle of "first, do no harm." The intent of the study
        is to enable an explosion of innovation in biomedical and health research by creating a large, stable, standard,
        open corpus of health and genomic information from an informed populace of volunteers.</p>

        collected by electronic means, including websites and software applications, and by a variety of different
        organizations, including disease research foundations, research institutions, hospitals, and companies engaged
        in health and life sciences research. Data collected under PLC-CGR will be made available to a broad variety of
        users for research purposes, with few controls on use other than the traditional medical principle of "first, do
        no harm." The intent of the study is to enable an explosion of innovation in biomedical and health research by
        creating a large, stable, standard, open corpus of health and genomic information from an informed populace of
        volunteers.</p>

    <h3 id="overview">ARTICLE II. OVERVIEW of Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research</h3>

    <p>Once you have completed the Portable Legal Consent process, which includes an educational module and video
        and the signing of this consent document online, you will see a screen on your computer or other device (such as
        a tablet) that allows you to begin uploading data about yourself.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, we will allow the upload of a small number of data types. If you have been genotyped (your
        genomic variation has been sequenced, or your full genome) then you will be able to upload the data for
        harvesting into the Study. If you have a copy of your health record, such as those available under the US
        Government's "Blue Button" format, you will be able to upload the data for harvesting into the Study. You will
        be able to take health surveys, like those you take when you go to a new doctor for the first time. You'll also
        be able to upload other data about yourself that is just now emerging technically, ranging from day to day
        observations about things like your weight to the data that your phone can capture that might be clinically
        important.</p>

    <p>
        It will always be your choice whether or not you want to upload any piece of data about yourself. Once you've
        uploaded data, it will be integrated with data from other people who have gone through Portable Consent and
        uploaded their own data, and used to generate new insights about health and biology. You will be able to delete
        the copy that you uploaded at any time, but since Common Genomic Research is intended to create a network of
        distributed and distributable data, <strong>we will probably not be able to retrieve copies of your
            data that have already been distributed.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3 id="duration_and_participation">ARTICLE III. DURATION OF Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research
        AND YOUR PARTICIPATION</h3>

    <p>This is an open-ended study that has no end date. We may choose to end the study at some point, but currently
        plan to maintain the Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research as an ongoing common resource. Your
        active participation is up to you. Once you have gone through the Portable Legal Consent, you can upload data
        once and never return, or you can return again and again to upload data as you get it, or to see what new kinds
        of data upload we have enabled since your last visit. It is completely your choice how long you wish to be an
        active participant. The first implementation of the study will be hosted at Sage Bionetworks, which is itself
        hosted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Clinic in Seattle, Washington, USA, although more implementations may be
        held at other organizations around the USA and the world over time. Sage Bionetworks will provide access to the
        data you upload, but not to information that can easily identify you such as your name, address, or birthday.</p>

    <p>Your participation will be through the internet. The study is completely voluntary, at all points and in all
        ways. There is no reimbursement of costs due to participation in the study. Part of the Portable Consent process
        creates a unique identifier (called a "Global User Identifier" or GUID) for you that creates the possibility for
        researchers to contact you without knowing who you are, so that you can choose to respond to requests to enroll
        in additional studies, to learn about revisions or updates to this document, and so forth. The connection
        between the GUID and your easily identifiable information will never be published. The choice to be
        recontactable will be voluntary and managed by the organization from which your Portable Consent was operated.
        The Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will make a public announcement at least once per year so
        that you might review and approve changes to this agreement.</p>

    <h3 id="additional_study_procedures">ARTICLE IV. Additional Study PROCEDURES</h3>

    <p>You will need to complete the online process, which includes indicating your understanding of key elements of
        the PLC-CGR study, and watch a short video that reinforces the potential benefits, potential risks, and concepts
        of the study, before you sign this document.</p>

    <h3 id="collection,_publication_and_return_of_data">ARTICLE V. Collection, publication and Return of data</h3>

    <h4>5.1 Collection of Baseline Data</h4>

    <p>To enroll in this study you will be asked to provide the following baseline data ("Baseline Data"): First
        Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Email Address, Gender. This data will be collected during the Portable Consent
        process and used to generate your unique ID and maintain a record of whether or not you wish to be recontacted.
        Only your unique ID, birth year, and gender will be extracted for redistribution. These fields will be
        free-entry except for Date of Birth and Gender.</p>

    <h4>5.2 Collection of Molecular Data</h4>

    <p>This project will not generate molecular data directly, but will instead collect data that you have generated
        yourself either through Direct to Consumer services or via interactions with other health care or research
        projects. Molecular data includes, but is not limited to, your "stable" genome data, your "dynamic" genome data,
        and other measurements that can emerge from your body.</p>

    <h5>(a) Stable genome data</h5>

    <p>This is the gene sequence that is carried in all of your cells. We call it "stable" genome data because it
        does not change over time - your gene sequence is unique to you. Stable genome data can also include multiple
        sequences from the same person - for example, a cancer patient might have a skin genome sequence, a blood
        genome, and a tumor genome sequence. Examples of stable genome data include, but are not limited to, genotypes
        (partial sequences of your genome, such as those provided by 23andme), exome sequences, and full genomes. We say
        that it includes, but is not limited to, these types because the machinery to examine our genomes is improving
        at incredible speed, and we want to make sure that this agreement does not have to be revised every time an
        innovative advance is made in the field.</p>

    <h5>(b) Dynamic genome data</h5>

    <p>This is data about how your genome reacts to the environment you live in: to diet, to medicines, to disease,
        to exercise, and more. The genes in your genome turn on and off in response to these kinds of external stimuli,
        and being able to measure which genes are turned on or off in a given situation is essential to understanding
        why and how the genome affects day to day health. Examples of dynamic genome data include, but are not limited
        to, gene expression, RNA expression, methylation, and more. We say that it includes, but is not limited to,
        these types because the machinery to examine our genomes is improving at incredible speed, and we want to make
        sure that this agreement does not have to be revised every time an innovative advance is made in the field. It
        is unlikely, though not impossible, that most patients will have this kind of data about themselves. But, it is
        very likely that if patients submit biological samples, that this kind of data is being generated - and that
        patients will have the right through other mechanisms to a copy of the data about themselves and then upload
        into a CGR framework or authorize a researcher to upload it on his or her behalf.</p>

    <h5>(c) Other measurements</h5>

    <p>There is an explosion in our capacity to gather data about the body, not just our genomes. We can now make an
        enormous set of measurements from a tiny drop of blood or urine, for example - to determine blood sugar levels,
        test cholesterol, look for allergies, and more. Doctors and clinical researchers often use this data in
        diagnosing patients and prescribing treatment regimes, so it's vital that you be able to upload this kind of
        data once you have access to your health records. This is data that researchers can combine with static and
        dynamic genomic data to turn into "models" of activity, so that we can start to tie the activities of doctors
        back to our genomes.</p>

    <h4>5.3 Collection of Other data</h4>

    <p>So far we have focused on data that is deeply tied to your body: your genome, its activity, and your tissues.
        But there is an enormous amount of data about your lifestyle that is not covered: how often you exercise, what
        you eat, how you live. This is data that can be gathered in any number of ways: via surveys, games, applications
        on phones, direct interactions with doctors, direct interactions with other patients, accessing your medical
        records, and more. This is data that has enormous potential value, and it is data that is increasingly under
        your control. We leave this definition intentionally vague, because it will be your choice what kinds of data
        about your lifestyle you would like to upload - but if you choose to upload it, that data will become part of
        the CGR framework.</p>

    <h4>5.4 Publication of Your Data</h4>

    <p>The Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research utilizes the CGR framework, which means that it has
        committed to publishing the data it collects and generates in the most widely accessible and publicly useful
        format possible. As part of your participation in this project, the personal data described above will be
        distributed via a database protected by password and available only to researchers who have registered and
        signed a contract agreeing to the user requirements of the CGR by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic
        Research and included as part of the CGR common database. A description of the CGR public database may be found
        in Section 5.8. A discussion of the risks associated with publishing the data gathered by Portable Legal Consent
        for Common Genomic Research in the CGR public database may be found in Article VI.</p>

    <h4>5.5 No Obligation</h4>

    <p>As a participant you are under no obligation to provide any data or information. However, you may not be able
        to participate in other aspects of Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research, until you supply the data
        or information described above or otherwise requested.</p>

    <h4>5.6 No Guarantees</h4>

    <p>Due to factors ranging from funding uncertainty to technological challenges, the Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research cannot make any guarantees about the accuracy, completeness or process time of any
        analysis, research or interpretation described in this section.</p>

    <h4>5.7 Limited Ability to Withdraw</h4>

    <p>Due to the nature of the CGR framework, your ability to fully withdraw from Portable Legal Consent for Common
        Genomic Research once some or all of the data described above has been published may be limited, as described in
        Article II.</p>

    <h4>5.8 Description of CGR Public Database</h4>

    <p>The CGR Public Database will consist of data that you choose to upload, which will be contained in records
        that are identified by the GUID described above. These records will contain data including genotypes, health
        records, survey answers, data emerging from new technology and more, but only data that you choose to upload.
        The baseline data described above will be sequestered in a different database that is never disclosed to the
        researchers using the data. Researchers accessing the data will be required to agree to rules under which they
        will not harm you, attempt to reidentify you, and more. These rules will be imposed either through notices on
        the websites for CGR database or through "click through" and registration software systems. In the beginning the
        CGR database will be hosted at Sage Bionetworks via the Synapse software system, which is itself already subject
        to ethical regulation and has received approval to distribute data under a separate regulatory application.</p>

    <h3 id="risks_and_discomforts">ARTICLE VI. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS</h3>

    <p>The CGR framework is designed to facilitate the development of a new form of public scientific research. We
        want participants to play a more active role in the management of their research experience and data, and to
        encourage the wide dissemination and active discussion of research data and results. Because this endeavor is
        relatively new, and because scientific research inherently breaks new technological and cultural ground, it is
        impossible to accurately predict all of the possible risks and discomforts that you might experience as a result
        of your participation in this study. In this section you will read about the risks that we have identified as
        potentially relevant to your participation in research projects adopting the CGR framework, like Portable Legal
        Consent for Common Genomic Research.</p>

    <p>You are strongly encouraged to think carefully about these risks, as well as any other risks or discomforts
        that you anticipate might arise as a result of your own unique circumstances. These might include your own
        health or medical conditions, your family and personal relationships or any other factor that is specific to
        you. In addition to understanding the risks outlined in this Article VI, you should feel confident that you have
        sufficient knowledge (via the educational materials and resources available on the CGR and Portable Legal
        Consent for Common Genomic Research websites or through other sources) of genetics, human subjects research and
        the benefits and risks of participation in this study to make an informed decision about whether participation
        is right for you.</p>

    <p>You are strongly encouraged to discuss this study and its potential risks with your immediate family members
        as well as with your doctor and/or other qualified health care providers. You are also encouraged to discuss
        with the Investigators directly any additional concerns that you may have regarding the risks to you of
        participating in this study. Finally, because the science in this area is evolving, and data will be collected
        on an ongoing basis by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research, the risks involved due to your
        participation in this study, as well as the likelihood and severity of such risks, will change over time. You
        will not be asked to review and re-sign this consent form every time new information related to the risk of
        participation becomes available.</p>

    <p>However, the CGR and Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will try to update this consent form
        and the study website as frequently as possible to reflect the latest information about the risks of
        participation. Participants and prospective participants are strongly encouraged to check the website regularly
        and to update their contact information with both the CGR and Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research
        in order to obtain the most current information regarding the risks and discomforts of participation.</p>

    <p>Please remember that you are free not to participate if you have not already enrolled, and to withdraw at any
        time if you have already enrolled in the study.</p>

    <h4>6.1 Risks Associated with the Publication of Your Data</h4>

    <h5>(a) Terms of Use</h5>

    <p>Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will require users to agree to a certain set of terms to
        access the data you provide.</p>

    <p>Users will at a minimum be presented with terms of use on the websites where data is available for use, and
        may be required to register, provide usernames and contact information, or sign a contract imposing certain
        behaviors on them that are part of the data. Users of the data will have to agree not to "harm" you (a general
        category meaning that you will not be discriminated against as a result of what is in your genome, described
        below), and to publish the results of their research in a way that allows you to read the research papers free
        of charge.</p>

    <p>However, this is a lightweight system of protection. It is possible that data can be accidentally disclosed,
        or maliciously extracted and republished without these protections. Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic
        Research will evict users who behave this way but cannot guarantee that your data will never become truly
        public. Thus, we believe it is ethically vital that you understand and consent to the risks associated with
        public disclosure of your data, even though your data is moving into the commons instead.</p>

    <h5>(b) Risks Associated with Public Disclosure</h5>

    <p>The risks of public disclosure of your genetic and trait data, including your DNA sequence data, or other
        information you provide, could affect the employment, insurance and financial well-being or social interactions
        of you and your immediate family. The following is a non-comprehensive list of hypothetical scenarios that could
        pose risks for you and/or your family:</p>

    <h6>(i) Public Disclosure of Genealogical Features</h6>

    <p>The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could cause you to learn - either directly, from a
        family member or from another individual - certain unexpected genealogical features about you and/or your
        family. This could include inferences or allegations that your relationships with family members or other
        individuals, or your ancestral or cultural origins, are different than you had previously believed. In
        particular, this could include inferences of non-paternity, as well as inferences or allegations of paternity
        made by individuals you did not previously know or suspect were related to you.</p>

    <h6>(ii) Family Genetic Propensity</h6>

    <p>Anyone with sufficient knowledge and resources could take your DNA sequence data and/or posted trait
        information and use that data, with or without changes, to: (A) accurately or inaccurately reveal to you or a
        member of your family the possibility of a disease or other trait or propensity for a disease or other trait;
        (B) claim statistical evidence, including with respect to your genetic predisposition to certain diseases or
        other traits, that could affect the ability of you and/or your family to obtain or maintain employment,
        insurance or financial services; (C) claim relatedness to criminals or other notorious figures or groups on the
        part of you and/or your family; (D) correctly or incorrectly associate you and/or your relatives with ongoing or
        unsolved criminal investigations on the basis of your publicly available genetic data; or (E) make synthetic DNA
        and plant it at a crime scene, or otherwise use it to falsely identify or implicate you and/or your family.</p>

    <h6>(iii) Discrimination</h6>

    <p>Whether or not it is lawful to do so, you could be subject to actual or attempted employment, insurance,
        financial, or other forms of discrimination or negative treatment due to the public disclosure of your genetic
        and trait information by the Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research or by a third party. Although
        the United States has a law that bars certain forms of genetic discrimination (the Genetic Information
        Nondiscrimination Act, also known as GINA), this law does not apply to the use of genetic information in all
        circumstances and, even where it does apply, it does not guarantee that your genetic information will not be
        used against you in a way that you feel is discriminatory or otherwise harmful to you and/or your family.</p>

    <h6>(iv) Recombination of Data</h6>

    <p>If you have previously made available or intend to make available genetic or other medical or trait
        information in a confidential setting, for example in another research study, the data that you provide to
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research may be used, on its own or in combination with your
        previously shared data, to identify you as a participant in otherwise private and/or confidential research. This
        means that any data or other information you may have shared pursuant to a promise of confidentiality or privacy
        may become public despite your intent that they be kept private and confidential. This could result in certain
        adverse effects for you, including ones not considered or anticipated by this consent form.</p>

    <h6>(v) Identification</h6>

    <p>Data that you provide (such as trait data or DNA sequence or other genetic data) may be used to identify you,
        resulting in contact from the press and other members of the public motivated by positive or negative feelings
        about the study. This could mean a significant loss of privacy and personal time.</p>

    <h6>(vi) Application to Family</h6>

    <p>Your publicly available DNA sequence data, trait data and other information will include certain information
        that applies to your family members. Some people may draw conclusions from your publicly available information,
        including speculating about what such information might reveal about you and your family members. As a result,
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research cannot predict all of the risks, or the severity of the
        risks, that the public availability of this information may pose to you and your relatives. You are strongly
        encouraged to discuss this study and its potential risks, including the fact that not all of the risks are
        known, with your immediate family members.</p>

    <h5>(c) Possibility of Unintended Public Disclosure</h5>

    <p>If you enroll in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research, it is possible that data not intended to
        be published (e.g., your name, date of birth, or contact information) will be publicly disclosed due to
        unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by Portable
        Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research. Should this occur you would be subject to the various risks and
        discomforts described in this section and throughout this consent form, and possibly to other risks as well,
        even though you did not intend for such data to be published.</p>

    <h5>(d) Reproduction or Modification of your Data</h5>

    <p>If you choose to make your DNA sequence data and other information available, it will be published by
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research through the CGR common database and/or in other similar
        formats, and will be available with the restrictions described in 6.1 (a) to third parties. As a result, neither
        you nor the Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will be able to control or restrict the access,
        use, reproduction, modification or analysis of your data and other public information beyond those conditions in
        6.1 (a). Your data and other public information may be made public in other forms in addition to its inclusion
        in the CGR common database. It may also be altered, without your knowledge or your consent, in a way that might
        be inaccurate and or upsetting to you. For example, a third party could access your publicly available sequence
        data or other information, change it and republish it to suggest that you had a propensity for a disease or
        other detrimental trait. Additional adverse effects are also possible.</p>

    <h5>(e) Data Not to be Used for Medical Care</h5>

    <p>The data you upload to Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research, including research data, specimen
        analysis data (including your DNA sequence data) or any other reports, interpretations or findings generated or
        provided to you by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research, are not an appropriate substitute for
        professional medical or clinical advice, diagnosis or treatment, and may not be used by you for any medical or
        clinical purpose unless first confirmed by a licensed healthcare professional.</p>

    <h6>(i) Medical doctors do not routinely screen DNA sequence data for genetic variations comprehensively</h6>

    <p>Gene-specific sequencing is routinely performed but usually in the context of a positive personal or family
        medical history consistent with currently known genetic disorders. As such, the clinical importance of this data
        is not known with any certainty at this time for any population-based, genomic study like Portable Legal Consent
        for Common Genomic Research. The validity of many genetic associations, when screened for in the general
        population, remains uncertain.</p>

    <h6>(ii) Additional Interpretation</h6>

    <p>Regardless of any specific interpretations or findings made available to you by Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research, you are likely to be subjected to additional interpretations - both accurate and
        inaccurate - of your public data by people outside of the study.</p>

    <h5>(f) Risks Due to Pursuing Health or Medical Care</h5>

    <p>Your genome data (including your DNA sequence data) and interpretations or findings about your data may
        contain potentially alarming information, such as potentially harmful genetic variants. This may cause you to
        experience anxiety or stress. As a result, you may want to seek health or medical care or counseling to verify
        the accuracy of such interpretations, whether provided by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research or
        by other sources. If you choose to pursue health or medical care or counseling, you could be exposed to
        additional risks and/or discomforts, several of which are identified below.</p>

    <h5>(g) You are Responsible For Your Own Health or Medical Care</h5>

    <p>Neither the CGR entity operating an instance of the consent framework or Portable Legal Consent for Common
        Genomic Research will (i) provide you with, (ii) arrange for, (iii) pay for, reimburse you for or otherwise
        subsidize or (iv) provide you, your doctor or any other health care provider or insurer with any
        recommendations, advice or other guidance with respect to, any of your health or medical care, including any
        current or follow-up medical or clinical advice, counseling, diagnosis, treatment, preventative action or other
        related course of action of any kind.</p>

    <h6>(i) Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research is a research study</h6>

    <p>PLC-CGR is not responsible for any part of your health or medical care, including, accurately predicting
        disease or disease risk, informing you of genetic variations or providing you with accurate and valid DNA
        sequence data or interpretations of your DNA sequence data. No health or medical care of any kind will be made
        available by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research and, as described above, no special
        arrangements, for compensation or otherwise, will be made by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research
        should you require or choose to pursue any health or medical care as a result of your participation in Portable
        Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research.</p>

    <h6>(ii) You should talk to your doctor or other qualified health care provider if you have questions about any
        of your genetic or trait information</h6>

    <p>You should talk to your doctor or other qualified health care provider if you have questions about any of
        your genetic or trait information, including your specimen analysis data (including DNA sequence data) or any
        other interpretations or findings based on your data, whether or not provided by Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research. You should not ignore professional medical advice from your doctor or any other
        qualified health care provider about any of your genetic or trait data or other information provided or analyzed
        by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research. You should not interpret any analysis, interpretation or
        finding provided by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research as recommending or discouraging any
        specific treatment plan, product, or course of action with respect to your health or medical care.</p>

    <h6>(iii) Sole Responsibility</h6>

    <p>If after talking with your doctor or other qualified health care provider, you decide that any change in your
        health or medical care is necessary or advisable as a result of any information or interpretation you have
        received due to your participation in Portable Legal Consent - Common Genomic Research, you will be solely
        responsible for all resulting payments and costs associated with such health or medical care. You will also be
        solely responsible for consulting with your doctor, your health care provider and your health care insurance
        provider, if any, to determine whether any such costs would be covered or reimbursed.</p>

    <h6>(iv) Associated Risks and Expenses</h6>

    <p>Any health or medical care that you may determine is necessary, after consultation with your doctor or other
        qualified health care provider and whether as a result of your participation in this study or otherwise, may be
        invasive and have its own associated risks and expenses. Serious risks, including death, may be involved in any
        such health or medical care. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as whether you have the
        financial and other resources necessary to pursue such health or medical care.</p>

    <p>If your doctor or other qualified health care provider is directly or indirectly involved with Portable Legal
        Consent for Common Genomic Research, as either a researcher or a participant, any health or medical care that
        you receive from such health care provider, including medical advice or clinical management, represents health
        or medical care provided by that provider pursuant to your existing doctor-patient relationship, and is not
        health or medical care provided by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research.</p>

    <h4>6.2 Physical Risks and Discomforts.</h4>

    <p>There is no physical participation required for this study. If you are physically injured as a result or your
        participation in this study, please seek medical care immediately and contact the Principal Investigator.
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will not provide any health or medical care to participants.</p>

    <h3 id="benefits">ARTICLE VII. BENEFITS</h3>

    <h4>7.1 No Benefits to You</h4>

    <p>You are not likely to benefit in any way as a result of your participation in the Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research.</p>

    <h4>7.2 Benefits to Science and Access to Knowledge</h4>

    <p>The primary outputs of this study will be published, either in the traditional scientific literature or in
        newer forms such as blogs, wikis, software models of disease, and more. One of the Terms of Use that we will
        require of researchers is a commitment to publish their results under "Open Access" terms, which means that the
        outputs must be freely available on the public internet, permitting any users - including you - to read,
        download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles without financial, legal,
        or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. This is not a
        direct benefit to you, but to science and society, but through this Open Access requirement you will at least be
        able to access and read the research emerging from the study without having to pay fees.</p>

    <h4>7.3 Data return</h4>

    <p>If you enroll in a study that takes a biosample from you, and that study uses the CGR framework, either
        through this Consent Agreement or through another one that is deemed interoperable by the Consent to Research
        project, then you will be entitled to a copy of the raw molecular data that is generated from your biosample.
        You will not be entitled to processed, interpreted, or other versions of the data, and the caveats about medical
        care laid out in Article VI apply to this data as well. This section only applies if the investigators for a
        study have chosen to use the CGR framework and to return data to you.</p>

    <h3 id="intellectual_property">ARTICLE VIII. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>

    <h4>8.1 Promoting Open Access</h4>

    <p>One of the primary goals of the CGR framework is to develop public datasets supplied by willing research
        participants to aid in the development of analytical tools and interfaces for scientists, doctors, and
        individuals around the world. In order to accomplish this, the PGR endeavors to develop licenses, data
        structures and other tools to maximize the ability of the study to share its data in the broadest possible
        fashion, and Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research has adopted these principles. As noted above in
        7.2, scholarly outputs from the study are required by the Terms of Use to be made available under Open Access
        terms.</p>

    <h4>8.2 Ownership of Your Information and Data</h4>

    <p>Neither the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework nor Portable Legal Consent for Common
        Genomic Research will attempt to assert ownership of any information or data that you provide directly to
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research as part of your participation in the study. However, by
        participating in the study you grant to Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research and the CGR entity
        who runs an instance of the Consent framework a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable
        license to use such information and data without restriction including, without limitation, the right to
        sublicense, copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display and perform, publish, reproduce, edit, translate,
        reformat and create derivative works. This grant of rights is subject only to your ability to withdraw from the
        study, as described in Article X of this consent form. What this means is that users will be able to remix,
        build upon, and under certain conditions, make copies of the data you upload, without complex ownership
        conditions other than those in the user Terms of Use. Ultimately, however, it will be Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research's decision - consistent with the requirements imposed by the CGR entity who runs an
        instance of the Consent framework, this consent form, and applicable law - when and whether to make available
        such information, data and materials. Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research is unable to guarantee
        if, when or in what form you will receive access to any information, data or materials as part of your
        participation in this study.</p>

    <h4>8.3 No Licensing for Profit</h4>

    <p>Other than for purposes of recovering its costs, Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will not
        license or otherwise make available your data and personal information to any person, institution, company or
        other third party for the financial gain or commercial profit of Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic
        Research. Any information or data included in the CGR public database will be made available under a CC0 license
        and will not be licensed for commercial profit by the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework.
        However, information that you provide will be made available to third parties for research, patient care,
        commercial or other purposes, and these third parties may commercially profit from the data or other information
        that you contribute to Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research and the CGR common database. These
        third parties may also develop therapies, diagnostics, or applications that build upon your data indirectly.</p>

    <h4>8.4 No Compensation</h4>

    <p>You will not be compensated for your participation in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research
        commercial potential. Neither you nor your heirs will receive financial or any other benefits from any
        discoveries, whether or not of a commercial nature, made using the information and/or specimens that you
        provide.</p>

    <h3 id="confidentiality">ARTICLE IX. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>

    <h4>9.1 Limited Confidentiality After Publication</h4>

    <p>If you are enrolled in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research and choose to publish any of your
        data through the CGR common database, those data will be kept or made available by Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research or by the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework in a limited
        confidential fashion. Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research and the CGR entity who runs an instance
        of the Consent framework will require any collaborators or other individuals accessing your information to
        maintain such information in a de-identified fashion. Unless you withdraw from the study before your data are
        distributed, your genetic and trait data will be made available via a commonly accessible database with user
        controls and terms of use that protect confidentiality, but cannot guarantee complete confidentiality.</p>

    <h4>9.2 Association of Your Name With Your Data</h4>

    <p>Neither Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research nor the CGR entity who runs an instance of the
        Consent framework will intentionally associate your name with your genomic or trait data or other information
        that is published to the PGR public database or otherwise intentionally identify you as a participant in
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research without your prior consent. However, as described above,
        because of the identifiable nature of the information you provide to Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic
        Research, as well as the nature of the data and analyses generated by uses of the Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research and the common nature of the CGR database, it is possible that one or more third parties
        may identify you as a participant in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research. This may result in the
        association of your published data and other information with your name or other information that you have not
        provided to Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research Project and may not have wished to be publicly
        disclosed.</p>

    <h4>9.3 No Direct Disclosure to Your Health Care Provider</h4>

    <p>Your genetic and trait data will not be sent to your health care provider directly by Portable Legal Consent
        for Common Genomic Research and will not become part of your medical record due to any direct activities of
        Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research. However, because this information will be commonly
        available, and may be identified as yours, it could become part of your medical record or be shared with your
        doctor or other health care provider or your health care insurance provider, or provided to others due to the
        activities of one or more third parties.</p>

    <h4>9.4 Publication of Results</h4>

    <p>The results of Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research may be published in a medical book,
        journal, website or webpage, or used for teaching purposes. Identifying information that is associated with your
        data and/or the results of this study (such as your photograph, DNA sequence data, and medical or trait
        information, as well as your name if that has become associated with your study data by a third party during the
        course of your participation in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research), may be used in such
        publications or teaching materials. Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will not notify you prior
        to such uses, but you should regularly check the website to see if new results published under the Open Access
        terms described in 7.2 are available.</p>

    <h3 id="refusal_or_withdrawal_of_participation">ARTICLE X. REFUSAL OR WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATION</h3>

    <h4>10.1 Voluntary Participation</h4>

    <p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to participate in Portable Legal Consent for Common
        Genomic Research. You may withdraw your participation (including your data, subject to the limitations below)
        from this study at any time. You will never have to provide a reason for your withdrawal.</p>

    <h4>10.2 Limitations on Withdrawal</h4>

    <p>You are free to decide at any time that you no longer want your data or other information to be used as part
        of this study. However, it may not be possible to prevent the future use of your data or other information in
        certain circumstances.</p>

    <h4>10.3 Deletion of Trait and Sequence Data</h4>

    <p>If you choose to withdraw from the study and request that your genetic and trait data to be removed, you will
        send your unique Consent to Research Common Identifier to the project and within 6 months Portable Legal Consent
        for Common Genomic Research will delete all DNA sequence and trait data about you held by Portable Legal Consent
        for Common Genomic Research and will notify the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework of your
        withdrawal from Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research. Both the CGR entity who runs an instance of
        the Consent framework and Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will take reasonable steps to
        ensure that the data provided by you or generated by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research will not
        be included in future updates to the CGR public database. However, once any data or information about you is
        posted to the CGR public database, other organizations and individuals may acquire copies of it. There will be
        no way to ensure that they will delete their copies of your data or information, or for Portable Legal Consent
        for Common Genomic Research or the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework to even know what
        copies of your data or information may exist. Both Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research and the
        CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework will encourage researchers and other users to use the
        most current version of the CGR public database, but your data may be combined by Portable Legal Consent for
        Common Genomic Research and/or its collaborators or other third parties in ways that will make it impossible to
        delete them from such datasets.</p>

    <h4>10.4 Removal from the Study</h4>

    <p>Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research may decide to end your participation in this study at any
        time. If Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research terminates your participation it may provide you
        with an explanation. If your participation in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research is terminated,
        you may ask that Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research destroy or delete any of your data in
        accordance with the provisions set forth above. If neither you nor your Designated Proxy request that your data
        be destroyed or deleted upon the conclusion of your participation in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic
        Research, your data may be maintained by Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research consistent with this
        consent form and included indefinitely in the PGR public database.</p>

    <h4>10.5 Maintenance of Certain Information</h4>

    <p>If you decide to withdraw, or if Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research ends your participation,
        the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework may continue to keep certain limited information
        about you following the conclusion of your participation in Portable Legal Consent for Common Genomic Research,
        including your name, date of first participation, date of enrollment, date of termination or withdrawal and
        reason for termination or withdrawal.</p>
